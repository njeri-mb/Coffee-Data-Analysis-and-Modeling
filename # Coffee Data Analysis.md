# Coffee Data Analysis
![Coffee Cup]("C:\Users\HP\Downloads\download.jpeg")


## Project Overview
This project explores the relationships between key variables in the coffee industry: **Production**, **Exports**, and **Domestic Consumption**. The primary objective is to understand how these variables are correlated and to identify insights that could inform decisions in areas such as supply chain management, market focus, or resource allocation.

A correlation heatmap is used as the main visualization tool to represent the relationships between these variables, enabling quick interpretation of complex data patterns.

## Key Insights from the Analysis

### 1. **Production and Exports (Correlation: 0.97)**
   - This high correlation indicates that as coffee production increases, exports also tend to rise significantly. 
   - This suggests a strong dependency of the coffee export industry on production levels. For coffee-producing countries, strategies to enhance production could directly influence export revenues.

### 2. **Production and Domestic Consumption (Correlation: 0.91)**
   - While the correlation is slightly lower than production and exports, it remains substantial.
   - This highlights that a significant portion of the produced coffee is allocated for domestic consumption, reflecting potential cultural or local market importance in coffee-producing regions.

### 3. **Exports and Domestic Consumption**
   - This relationship has a weaker correlation compared to the others, as observed in the heatmap.
   - This may suggest that coffee-exporting nations prioritize international trade over meeting domestic demand, or that other factors (e.g., pricing, policies) impact this dynamic.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- The dataset used in this analysis includes variables for coffee production, export quantities, and domestic consumption over a specified time period. 

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled appropriately to ensure consistency in analysis.
- Data normalization and cleaning were performed to ensure accuracy in correlation computations.

### Correlation Analysis
- **Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient** was used to quantify the relationships between the variables. Values range from:
  - **1.0**: Perfect positive correlation.
  - **0.0**: No correlation.
  - **-1.0**: Perfect negative correlation.
  
### Visualization
- A heatmap was generated using the `seaborn` library to provide a visual representation of the correlation matrix. Darker shades of red represent stronger positive correlations, while blue indicates weaker relationships.
